# Blubito Meeting: State Management (in JavaScript)

These are the resources for a workshop done for my company at the time Blubito AG. You can use these examples however you desire and keep in mind that these workshops are based on my current/specific/limited/updated knowledge.

## How to use the slides
The slides here are using Markdown - decided to play around with this idea instead of using the same old hated PowerPoint layout. Please add/use [Marp VS Code Extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) for using the slides in the best way possible.
