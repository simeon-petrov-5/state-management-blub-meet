# Blubito Meeting: State Management (in JavaScript)

These are the resources for a meeting done for my company at the time Blubito AG. You can use these examples however you desire.

These meetings are aimed at more junior developers and people who desire to develop themselves more and discuss different, mainly front-end, subjects. Keep in mind that these slides are based on my current/specific/limited/updated knowledge at the time and probably you can disagree with some of them - feel free to let me know and discuss them.

# Preview
The slides are deployed and accessible on [netlify](https://state-management-blubito-meeting.netlify.app/)
## How to use the slides
The slides here are using Markdown - decided to play around with this idea instead of using the same old hated PowerPoint layout. 

The project uses [Marp](https://github.com/yhatt/marp-cli-example) - add/use [Marp VS Code Extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) for easiest local preview.
